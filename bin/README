The mklib.* scripts are use to make shared libraries on different
flavors of Unix (and other Unix-like OSes).  But these scripts are
only used with the Makefile.X11 (and similar) makefiles.  These
scripts are NOT used by GNU configure.

In all cases, the command line arguments are:

	mklib libname major minor tiny file.o [...]

where
	libname = the library name ("libGL.so" for example)
	major = the major version number ("1" for example)
	minor = the minor version number ("2" for example)
	tiny = the tiny version number ("310" for example)
	file.o [...] = the list of one or more object files

On most OSes, the final library name will be of the form:
	libname.major.minor.tiny

For example,
	mklib libGL.so 1 2 310 file.o ...

would generate the library named "libGL.so.1.2.310" which would be
the Mesa 3.1.0 implementation of the OpenGL 1.2 spec.
