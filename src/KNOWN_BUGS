Performance issues with EXT_point_parameters & quake2


Broken drivers: 

	--> After integration of the changes in kw3, only the X and FX
drivers are known to work.  Windows and D3D are known to be broken,
and all others are suspected to be broken.  Please test your driver
and update this entry when more is known.



Separate specular color interpolation isn't implemented for points and
lines.  Also, will have to add specular color add to pb.c (pixel buffer
code).
