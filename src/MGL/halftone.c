/****************************************************************************
DESCRIPTION:
Returns a copy of the MGL halftone palette.

HEADER:
mgraph.h

PARAMETERS:
pal	- Place to store the halftone palette values

REMARKS:
This function copies the MGL halftone palette into the specified palette structure.
The halftone palette always contains 256 colors, and hence the palette array must
contain 256 palette entries. This palette is a special palette used by MGL when
running in RGB dithered rasterizing mode for 8 bit video modes. If you intend to
enable RGB dithering with the MGL_setColorMapMode function, you must get a
copy of the halftone palette and program the hardware palette for your display
device or windowed device to be the same as this halftone palette.

Note that the MGL halftone palette is compatible with the standard Windows
halftone palette, so you can perform 8 bit dithering operations in a window without
needing to go into SYSPAL_STATIC mode.

y	- y pixel coordinate
R	- Red component for pixel color
G	- Green component for pixel color

RETURNS:
Color index for the pixel in MGL halftone palette

REMARKS:
This function computes the color index for a specified 24 bit RGB pixel value in the
standard MGL halftone palette, and can be used to perform real-time dithering of
pixel values from RGB colors to color index colors. This routine uses a fast table
lookup and an 8x8 ordered dither to do the conversion.
